            comment:"Himachal Pradesh is perhaps the most enchanting, picturesque and quiet states in Indium. Favored with excellent valleys, glorious mountains spouting streams and perfect white snow, this state is absolutely an otherworldly fairyland. Gotten from the Sanskrit words'Him' importance snow and'Achal' meaning home or land, it in a real sense implies home or place where there is snow.Fluctuating from cold and blanketed Alpine mountains to rich green sub-jungle valleys, the territory of Himachal Pradesh has welcomed many to choose its properties since as right on time as the Indus Valley Civilization. The travel industry here is thriving as Himachal is home to numerous beautiful slope stations. You can gaze upon charming pilgrim style engineering that creates the scene of Shimla, experience an increased feeling of otherworldliness at Dharamsala or go skiing and traveling in Kullu and Manali. With a particularly assorted scene you can anticipate that pleasant surprises should come your direction every step of the way in Himachal. Arranged in North India, Himachal Pradesh has a charmingly cool environment practically throughout the entire year. Nonetheless, it is encouraged to visit the state during the months from October to June to partake in a delightful environment and not let downpour hamper your arrangements."

Gujarat is the fifth-largest Indian state by area, covering some 196,024 km2 (75,685 sq mi); and the ninth-most populous state, with a population of 60.4 million. It is bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south, Maharashtra to the southeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani province of Sindh to the west. Gujarat's capital city is Gandhinagar, while its largest city is Ahmedabad. The Gujaratis are indigenous to the state and their language, Gujarati, is the state's official language. The state encompasses 23 sites of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation (more than any other state). The most important sites are Lothal (the world's first dry dock), Dholavira (the fifth largest site), and Gola Dhoro (where 5 uncommon seals were found). Lothal is believed to have been one of the world's first seaports. Gujarat's coastal cities, chiefly Bharuch and Khambhat,[14] served as ports and trading centres in the Maurya and Gupta empires, and during the succession of royal Saka dynasties in the Western Satraps era. Along with Bihar, Mizoram and Nagaland, Gujarat is one of four Indian states to prohibit the sale of alcohol. The Gir Forest National Park in Gujarat is home to the only wild population of the Asiatic lion in the world."

The Line of Control separates Jammu and Kashmir from the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and north. It lies to the north of the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and to the west of Ladakh which is administered by India as a union territory. Provisions for the formation of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir were contained within the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which was passed by both houses of the Parliament of India in August 2019. The act re-constituted the former state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories, one being Jammu and Kashmir and the other being Ladakh, with effect from 31 October 2019."

Chandigarh is bordered by the State of Punjab to the north, west and the south, and by the State of Haryana to the east, the states for which it serves as the capital. It constitutes the bulk of the Chandigarh Capital Region or Greater Chandigarh, which also includes the adjacent satellite cities of Panchkula and Mohali. It is located 260 km (162 miles) north of New Delhi and 229 km (143 miles) southeast of Amritsar.Chandigarh is one of the earliest planned cities in post independence India and is internationally known for its architecture and urban design.[8] The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, which built upon earlier plans created by the Polish architect Maciej Nowicki and the American planner Albert Mayer. Most of the government buildings and housing in the city were designed by a team headed by Le Corbusier, Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry. Chandigarh's Capitol Complex—as part of a global ensemble of Corbusier's buildings—was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO at the 40th session of the World Heritage Conference in July 2016."
